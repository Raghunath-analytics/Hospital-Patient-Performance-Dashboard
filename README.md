## 🎯 Project Objective

This project focuses on creating a comprehensive **Hospital Patient Performance Dashboard** to track and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) related to patient data, surgery outcomes, room occupancy, and medical operations. The objective is to empower hospital administrators with real-time insights for better decision-making and operational efficiency.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

- Patient Demographics & Status
- Surgery Details
- Test Records
- Room Allocation & Availability
- Doctor Performance
- Pharmacy & Billing Information

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques Used
- **SQL (MS SQL Server)** – Data Extraction, Cleaning & Modeling  
- **Power BI Desktop** – Dashboard Development  
- **DAX** – Calculated Columns, KPIs, and Advanced Logic  
- **Power Query** – Data Transformation  
- **Bookmarks & Navigation** – Seamless UX  
- **Conditional Formatting** – Highlighting performance metrics  

## 🔄 Process Followed
1. **Data Extraction** – Queried multiple hospital datasets using SQL
2. **Data Cleaning** – Removed nulls, duplicates, standardized date formats
3. **Data Modeling** – Built star schema with fact and dimension tables
4. **DAX Measures** – Created custom KPIs and time-based logic
5. **Visualization** – Designed charts, slicers, and interactive visuals
6. **User Experience** – Implemented bookmarks, navigation buttons, and tooltips

## 🧗 Challenges Faced
- 🔁 **Multi-source Integration** – Combining surgery, patient, pharmacy, and billing data required careful data modeling  
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning in SQL** – Dealing with missing values and non-standard formats  
- 🧠 **Complex DAX Measures** – KPIs like discharge %, length of stay, and room utilization took time to perfect  
- ⚙️ **Performance Optimization** – Dashboard responsiveness improved by reducing visuals and optimizing filters  
- 🔄 **Slicer Synchronization** – Needed bookmarks & sync setup for cross-page filtering  
   
## 📚 Key Learnings
- ✅ Enhanced skills in **SQL for BI applications** in the healthcare domain  
- ✅ Mastered **DAX formulas** including CALCULATE(), FILTER(), and context transitions  
- ✅ Improved knowledge of **Power BI best practices** — slicers, bookmarks, tooltips  
- ✅ Gained insights into **healthcare KPIs** and hospital operational metrics  

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- 📲 **Mobile-Responsive Dashboard** for on-the-go hospital administrators  
- 📡 **Real-Time Integration** with hospital systems using Power BI Gateway  
- 🧠 **Predictive Modeling** to forecast patient readmissions or occupancy  
- 🌍 **Geo-Mapping** of patient origins for regional planning  
- 📋 **Feedback Dashboard** to track patient satisfaction  
- 💹 **Profitability Layer** — combine financial and operational data for ROI analysis  

## ✅ Final Conclusion
- Through this solution, healthcare administrators and stakeholders can monitor key metrics such as patient admissions, discharge trends, room utilization, billing, and staff performance — all in real-time. The     dashboard fosters a data-driven culture within hospital management, enabling faster responses, improved patient experiences, and optimized resource allocation.

- Moving forward, integrating real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and automated alert systems can further enhance this tool's impact, supporting proactive care and strategic hospital planning in a rapidly   evolving healthcare environment.
